      <h1 class="over">OVERVIEW OF PRAGUE</h1>
      <p class="abdul">
       <em><strong>Prague</strong></em> is mostly famous for being the capital of Czech Republic, therefore
       being called the Heart of Europe due to Czech Republic being the heart of
       Europe. Architecture is very well-preserved in the entire Czech Republic so
       tourists mostly think those beautiful buildings are only in our capital city.
       <em><strong>Prague</strong></em> is famous for many styles of architecture from the Gothic through
       cubist to the controversial 1996 ultra modern <em>‘Dancing House’</em>. It is known
       for unique historical monuments too: <em>the oldest astronomical clock in the
       world that still functions (installed in 1410) and the Charles Bridge,
       a pedestrian bridge lined with Baroque statues that spans the Vltava River</em>.</p>

      <h2 class="over">LIST OF PLACES TO VISIT IN PRAGUE</h2>
      <ol>
        <li class="faree">INFANT JESUS OF PRAGUE</li><p></p>
        <img src="..\pics\infant.jpg" alt="infant of jesus" width='300px'>
        <p class="abdul">Located in the Mala Strana in the heart of the city, the Infant Jesus of Prague (also known as the Child of Prague)
           is a Roman Catholic statue of Jesus Christ as an infant. Everyday hundreds of believers pay a visit to this shrine
           to pray, bow and make wishes hoping that they will come true. The statue itself is encased in an ornate gilded shrine
           and while the origin of the figure is unknown, it has been dated back to the 16th Century.</p>

        <li class="faree">OLD TOWN SQUARE</li><p></p>
        <img src="..\pics\old town.jpg" alt="old town" width='300px'>
        <p class="abdul">Despite Prague’s lively history of invasions, the Old Town Square has remained relatively untouched since the 10th
           Century. Swarms of tourists crowd the historical streets, packing out the alfresco restaurants everyday. The square
           itself is the perfect place to admire the wonderful architecture Prague has to offer and if that isn’t your thing
           then the various street performers, musicians and merchants that line the streets here will certainly keep you
           entertained.</p>

        <li class="faree">CHARLES BRIDGE</li><p></p>
        <img src="..\pics\bridge.jpg" alt="charles bridge"  width='300px'>
        <p class="abdul">Whoever said that “the best things in life are free” may well have been referring to the Charles Bridge in Prague.
           A simple walk across the 14th Century bridge is one of the most enjoyable and memorable experiences of visiting Prague.
           The bridge was commissioned in 1357 by Charles IV to replace an older bridge that had been washed away by floods.</p>

        <li class="faree">PRAGUE CASTLE</li><p></p>
        <img src="..\pics\castle.jpg" alt="prague castle"  width='300px'>
        <p class="abdul">Located in Hradcany (the Castle district), Prague Castle is without a doubt the city’s most popular tourist
           attraction and it is easy to see why. The breath-taking castle has traditionally been the seat of Czech rulers and
           is today the official residence of the president. Entry to the grounds of the castle are free although many buildings
           such as the St Vitus cathedral, Basillica of St George and Golden Lane can be visited with a combined entry ticket.</p>

        <li class="faree">GOLDEN LANE</li><p></p>
        <img src="..\pics\lane.jpg" alt="golden lane"  width='300px'>
        <p class="abdul">Also located within the grounds of the castle is the mysterious Golden Lane, so called because, according to legends,
           alchemists had to look on this street to find a reaction to turn ordinary materials into gold. Despite the streets name,
           it is debated whether alchemists ever worked or lived here. Czech-Jewish writer Franz Kafka used a house on the street
           for around two years as he enjoyed the peaceful environment it provided whilst writing.</p>
