      <h1>Adverse Technology!</h1>
      <p>The over utilization of technology, its abuse, is unweaving humanity at
      the seams.<br> Human health, sanity, and spirituality are under attack.
      <br> The boom of accessibility over technology has increasingly
      subtracted from the<br> frequency of face to face human interaction as well
      as human interaction with nature.</p>
