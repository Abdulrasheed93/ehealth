        <p>The <em>Okapi</em> is awesome because <strong>it has striped markings, which may resemble that of zebras,
           though it is more closely related to the giraffe.</strong> The okapi is also known as the forest giraffe
           or zebra giraffe, it is a native to Democratic Republic of the Congo in Central Africa.</p>
